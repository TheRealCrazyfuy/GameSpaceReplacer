## Description

**Game Space Replacer** is an Android app that allows you to customize the functionality of the red switch on your REDMAGIC device.

With this app, you can replace the default behavior of the red switch to launch your favorite game or app automatically when triggered.

## Features

- **Custom app selector**: Choose which app should launch when the red switch is pressed.
- **Minimal UI**: Clean, simple interface to manage the red switch functionality.
- **Privacy friendly**: Open source and no internet access, we don't store your data!

## Requirements

- Any Global modern REDMAGIC device running REDMAGIC OS.
- Necessary permissions:
  - Usage Stats Permission > Check if the Game Space has been launched.
  - Display over other apps permission > Launch a different app on top of the Game Space.

## Tested Devices

The app has been tested on the following devices:

- ✅ **REDMAGIC 7s Pro**
- ✅ **REDMAGIC 8 Pro**
- ✅ **REDMAGIC 10 Pro**

It should work on any modern REDMAGIC device. If you encounter any issues, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub. **Note that the Chinese firmware isn't officially supported.**

## Common Issues
- **REDMAGIC 10 Devices must have set the switch to launch the Game Space.**
- The REDMAGIC Game Space briefly appears before the selected app launches.
- When Installing the apk Play Protect will complain about the app made for an older Android version, you have to press on `Learn more` and `Install anyways`.

## Installation
- Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/TheRealCrazyfuy/GameSpaceReplacer/releases) and download the latest release.
- Once the download is finished open the `.apk` and install it.
- Then just follow the instructions inside the app.
- **On Android 15+ you have to manually give these permissions from settings. [Learn more](https://www.androidpolice.com/android-15-sideloading-restrictions-bad-users/)**
